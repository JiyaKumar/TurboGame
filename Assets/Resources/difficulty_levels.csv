The sun is bright. I love apples. She sings well. Dogs are friendly. We play in the park. The cake is sweet. He runs fast. I see a rainbow. The bird can fly. Milk is white.
The cat is sleeping. I read books. She has a red dress. The flowers smell nice. We eat rice. The moon is round. Frogs can jump. The water is cold. My bike is blue. The stars are shining.
We go to school. Mom makes pancakes. Dad drives a car. The dog barks. It is raining today. I have a pet fish. The tree is tall. I wear a hat. The baby is smiling. We sing songs together.
My brother plays football. She likes to dance. The boy has a toy. I have a new book. The sky is blue. Birds build nests. The flowers bloom in spring. We drink fresh juice. The puppy is very small. I love ice cream.
The river flows calmly. The bus is very big. The balloon is red. Grandpa tells great stories. I found a shiny coin. My father reads newspapers. The squirrel jumps on trees. We celebrate birthdays happily. The road is very wide. The sun sets in the evening.
She picks fresh mangoes. The little girl runs fast. Grandpa sits under the tree. The house has a blue door. The baby claps her hands. The birds chirp in the morning. The dog wags its tail. The rain makes puddles. The moonlight is soft. The stars twinkle at night.
Mom makes delicious cookies. The garden has colorful flowers. We play hide and seek. The car moves on the road. The kite flies in the sky. The fish swims in the water. The clock shows the time. I drink warm milk. The snow covers the ground. The chair is made of wood.
The rainbow has many colors. The cow gives us milk. I draw pictures with crayons. The bus stops at the station. The clouds look fluffy. The cat jumps on the table. We eat fresh fruits daily. The tree gives shade. The baby laughs loudly. Dad fixes the broken chair.
The little rabbit hops around. The cake smells delicious. The baby sleeps peacefully. I love my teddy bear. The teacher tells a story. The bell rings loudly. The lamp lights up the room. The girl combs her hair. We drink cold lemonade. The bird sings a sweet song.
The ocean waves crash on the shore. The squirrel hides its nuts. The book has colorful pictures. The apple falls from the tree. The butterfly sits on a flower. The children play in the sand. The clock ticks every second. The wind blows softly. The candle glows in the dark. The car honks on the road.
